# Sync Resources

Komodo is able to create, update, delete, and deploy resources declared in TOML files by diffing them against the existing resources, 
and apply updates based on the diffs. Push the files to a remote git repo and create a `ResourceSync` pointing to the repo,
and the core backend will poll for any updates (you can also manually trigger an update poll / execution in the UI).

File detection is additive and recursive, so you can spread out your resource declarations across any number of files
and use any nesting of folders to organize resources inside a root folder. Additionally, you can create multiple `ResourceSyncs`
and each sync will be handled independently. This allows different syncs to manage resources on a "per-project" basis.

The UI will display the computed sync actions and only execute them upon manual confirmation.
Or the sync execution git webhook may be configured on the git repo to
automatically execute syncs upon pushes to the configured branch.
